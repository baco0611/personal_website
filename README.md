# Bao Huynh Resume Website

Hi there,

Welcome to my resume website! I built this site using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allowed me to create a modular and maintainable codebase, making it easy to update and expand my resume over time. By leveraging React's state management and hooks, I was able to implement dynamic features and ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. This project has been a fantastic opportunity to showcase not only my skills and experiences but also my proficiency in modern web development techniques.
